# SATELLITE-IMAGE-PROCESIING-USING-CNN-
I have created a deep learning model to classify satellite images. The goal was to identify different land cover types, such as annual crop, forest, herbaceous vegetation, etc. I trained four CNN models namely DenseNet121, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, and InceptionV3 on an image dataset and evaluated their performance on the basis of their accuracy.
